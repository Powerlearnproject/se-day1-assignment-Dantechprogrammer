#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the process of designing, developing, testing,  deploying and maintining software products. Its important in techology industries as it helps develop solutions in healthcare,  business and education.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

Some of the key milestones in software enginering include the establishment of software engineering
as a discipline in the 1960s, the advent of structured programming in the 1970s, and
the rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

The key phases of software engineering include:

1. Requirements Analysis-  Understanding what the users need and documenting these requirements to guide development.
2. Design - Structuring the software in terms of architecture, modules, and components.
3. Development - Writing the code based on the design specifications.
4. Testing - Checking the software for bugs, errors, and ensuring it meets the required standards.
5. Deployment - Releasing the software for use.
6. Maintenance - Ongoing updates, bug fixes, and improvements after the software is deployed.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall methodology is a sequential approach with distinct phases (e.g., requirements, design,
implementation) flowing downwards like a waterfall. It is ideal when  all the software requirements are known and no changes are expected within the SDLC. On the other hand, agile methodology is an iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and
responding to change. Itis suitable for projects where numerous changes and continous testing is expected in the project.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

1. Software Developer: Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
2. Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test
plans.
3. Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects
   
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) are software suites that provide
comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code (e.g., Visual Studio and Pycharm).

Version Control Systems (VCS) are software tools for tracking changes to source code and
coordinating work among team members (e.g., Git, BitBucket).

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Software engineers encounter various challenges throughout the development process,
including:
1. Changing Requirements: Requirements may change during the development cycle,
leading to scope creep and project delays.
2. Tight Deadlines: Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed
development and compromised quality.
3. Technical Debt: Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can
impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.

Strategies for Overcoming these Challenges: Strategies for overcoming challenges include
effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular
reassessment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

 The diffrent  types oftesting include: 
 - Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.
 - Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
 - System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
 - Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user
needs.
Testing is important as it helps software engineers identify and fix bugs early in the development
process, leading to higher-quality software products

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models. 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

An example is instead of saying 'Translate this,' you could say, 'Translate this English sentence to Spanish.'" The improved prompt is more effective as its more detailed,  specific and consice thus AI is able to  provide a more relevant  and detailed response.
